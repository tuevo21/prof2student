# Prof2Student

web application for professor-student interaction. You can visit the professor version at professorlogin2016.herokuapp.com and the student version at studentlogin2016.herokuapp.com
This is my final project in CS 284: Database Design.

###Stack

I use Bootstrap, JS, Flask and PostgreSQL. I deploy the app on Heroku. You can download it and run on Heroku if you like; however, this is not intended for commercial usage or any other type of usage. I did this for fun.
